# Getting Started

[DeckDeckGo] provides a [CLI](https://github.com/deckgo/create-deckdeckgo) and a [starter kit](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo-starter).

To get started and **to create your presentation**, run the following command and follow the prompt:

```bash
npm init deckdeckgo
```

Once your presentation created, go to your new project's folder and start editing your slides and content for your talk ðŸ˜‰
