# Theming

[DeckDeckGo] offers various theming options which could be set using CSS variables and which are described in their respective slides' templates, see chapter [concept](/slides/concept) to begin with.

*Note: If you would miss or need further theming options, don't hesitate to open an issue and/or submit a PR, it would be my pleasure to add more theming flexibility and options*
