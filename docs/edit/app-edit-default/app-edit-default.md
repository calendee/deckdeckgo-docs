# HTML

To edit your [DeckDeckGo] presentation your could either use **HTML** or **Markdown**.

The default language is **HTML**. It's also the recommended language as it will offers you more flexibility specially regarding styling.

If you use the starter kit and use HTML as language for the edition, you could begin to edit the `index.html` of your project as displayed in the chapter [Concept](/slides/concept).

If you wish to edit your talk using **Markdown** have a look to [the next chapter](/edit/markdown).
