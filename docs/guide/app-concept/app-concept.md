# Concept

[DeckDeckGo] is a deck of slides where each slide is based on a template which has its own layout and behaviour. Their content could be edited and structured using `slots` and other attributes.

The parent deck should be declared using the tag `<deckgo-deck/>` and each slide should be added as its children.

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-title>
    <h1 slot="title">The first slide</h1>
    <p slot="content">
      Hello World ðŸš€
    </p>
  </deckgo-slide-title>
  
  <deckgo-slide-content>
      <h1 slot="title">The second slide</h1>
  </deckgo-slide-content>
</deckgo-deck>
```

In the previous example, the presentation contains two slides. The first slide use the template `deckgo-slide-title` and the second slide use the template `deckgo-slide-content`.

All templates and their options are described in the following chapters.
