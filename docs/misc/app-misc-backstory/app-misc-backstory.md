# Backstory

I had the opportunity to talk about Web Components and Ionic. While I was developing my presentation it came to my mind that I was not really following what I was about to present, that's why I wrapped up together [DeckDeckGo], this new tool to create a Progressive Web App alternative for simple presentations using Web Components.

I hope my little project will help you to create a slick presentation ðŸš€

To infinity and beyond ðŸ––
